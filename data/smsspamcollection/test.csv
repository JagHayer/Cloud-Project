" with great sound effects, and impressive special effects, i can't recommend this movie enough.
positive	call me a nut, but i think this is one of the best movies ever.
positive	great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle.
negative	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of good lord, what were they thinking?
negative	lots of holes in the script.
negative	it's like a bad two hour tv movie.
negative	now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.
negative	the dialogue is atrocious.
negative	the acting is beyond abysmal.
negative	everything stinks.
negative	trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.
negative	worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.
negative	it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.
negative	in short, don't bother with this movie.
positive	i won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.
positive	the best scene in the movie is at the end, but i won't spoil it.
positive	if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!
positive	the result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.
positive	a film not easily forgotten.
positive	but, kevin spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.
positive	the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.
positive	the characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.
positive	highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!
positive	great movie!
negative	also the story and acting were weak.
negative	at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.
negative	either way, it sucks.
negative	the script is horrendously stupid.
negative	the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.
negative	everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.
negative	what the hell kind of crap is that?!
negative	then, there's the plot holes.
negative	you could drive a semi truck into these holes!
positive	linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film.
positive	she's poised and amazing.
negative	dee snider just plain sucks.
negative	he can't act (one of the least scary villains i have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?
negative	i was bored throughout the whole damn thing.
negative	the acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special fx suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.
negative	this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.
negative	this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life.
negative	a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.
negative	avoid at any and all costs.
negative	at any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.
negative	avoid this film at all costs.
negative	i don't know what happened in season five, what a mess.
negative	the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.
negative	now this is a movie i really dislike.
negative	it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.
negative	the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks.
negative	the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.
negative	there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.
negative	i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.
positive	the fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.
positive	the best part about nurse betty"" is it's unpredictability.",positive
avoid this one if you can.,negative
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,negative
non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.,positive
i was hoping for more.,negative
juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south.,positive
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,positive
"you get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.",positive
all the other cases i've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,positive
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.,positive
this is a disgrace.,negative
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and i'm pretty happy with that decision.,positive
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.,positive
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,negative
"anyways, the food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.",negative
terrible management.,negative
the service was extremely slow.,negative
i great reception all the time.,positive
"the mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.",negative

"i really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!",positive
it's pretty easy.,positive
this place has it!,positive
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.,negative
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.,negative
i'll be looking for a new earpiece.,negative
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life.,negative
first time there and might just be the last.,negative
nicest chinese restaurant i've been in a while.,positive
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles?,negative
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.,positive
"the burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.",negative
i just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine.,negative
will go back next trip out.,positive
"it is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.",negative
"i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.but if anyone has a question about fort steele, just ask away:)",positive
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,negative
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.,positive
"of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.",positive
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.,positive
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad.,negative
nice ambiance.,positive
"this really is how vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",positive
"the scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.",negative
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard.,positive
food was really good and i got full petty fast.,positive
easy to use.,positive
"the menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",negative
"other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.",positive
just what i wanted.,positive
"the point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.",positive
it's just painful!,negative
"i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, i really abhor it.",negative
still waiting...... i'm sure this item would work well.. if i ever recieve it!,negative
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .i recommend you this case !!,positive
"i've dropped my phone more times than i can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).",positive
very tough and very short on flavor!,negative
i just saw this film and i recommend it.,positive
"best buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.",positive
"the sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.",positive
do not buy for d807...wrongly advertised for d807.,negative
earbud piece breaks easily.,negative
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts.,negative
"first off the reception sucks, i have never had more than 2 bars, ever.",negative
this is a great deal.,positive
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.,negative
design flaw?.,negative
i love this place.,positive
"as a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the american justice system, it's frightening.",positive
service was fantastic.,positive
the waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,negative
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,negative
"in fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.",negative
"it was that year, however, that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella ""the dead.",positive
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving.,negative
i'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,positive
in short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film.,negative
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.,negative
this is a good joint.,positive
it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema!,positive
i recently tried caballero's and i have been back every week since!,positive
"you can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.",negative
"technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.",positive
it's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an lg).,negative
"loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.",positive
"i put the latest os on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.",negative
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no!,negative
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,positive
brilliance indeed.,positive
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish.,positive
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device.,negative
"well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.",positive
very slow at seating even with reservation.,negative
"audio quality is poor, very poor.",negative
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic!,positive
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying.,negative
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.,negative
service is also cute.,positive
what a disappointment,negative
it was pretty gross!,negative
doesn't work at all.. i bougth it for my l7c and its not working.,negative
the result is a film that just don't look right.,negative
"great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.",positive
returned 8 hours later.,negative
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,positive
the igo chargers and tips are really great.,positive
"the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly grimes and blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.",positive
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,positive
"i go to far too many places and i've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.",negative
also makes it easier to hold on to.,positive
"i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.",negative
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.,negative
would recommend this item.,positive
it is simple to use and i like it.,positive
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,positive
the nano stated it.my son was dissapointed.,negative
this is a great deal.,positive
unreliable - i'm giving up.,negative
they keep getting better and better (this is my third one and i've had numerous palms too).,positive
but it picked up speed and got right to the point.,positive
"very, very sad.",negative
new battery works great in phone.,positive
don't waste your money.,negative
"stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman, very friendly, kind staff.",positive

"the acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.",negative
now i know that i made a wise decision.,positive
it wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,negative
"and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.",positive
* both the hot & sour & the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars!,positive
better than expected.,positive
awesome service and food.,positive
"for service, i give them no stars.",negative
he's a national treasure.,positive
delicious!!,positive
phone falls out easily.,negative
"if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.",negative
waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!,negative
the selection of food was not the best.,negative
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,negative
soggy and not good.,negative
once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.,positive
clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.,positive
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.,negative
"let's start with all the problemsâ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.",negative
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you.""",negative
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.,positive
this is the first phone i've had that has been so cheaply made.,negative
thank you for such great service.,positive
it has all the features i want,positive
"i guess i should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the excalibur, but i didn't use my common sense.",negative
"it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.",positive
poor talk time performance.,negative
") very bad performance plays angela bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.",negative
nice leather.,positive
now you know why i gave it a 10+!,positive
the picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.,negative
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv...never mind the fact that i already have it memorized!,positive
"special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.",positive
"i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the fire red and it's a great color!",positive
crisp and clear.,positive
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.,positive
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.,positive
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tv's.,positive
"yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.",negative
they know how to make them here.,positive
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.,negative
the service here is fair at best.,negative
i've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.,negative
it has everything i need and i couldn't ask for more.,positive
i love this place.,positive
one of my favorite purchases ever.,positive
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.,positive
"there is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",negative
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren (tom hollander).,positive
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.,positive
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.,negative
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.,negative
the fries were great too.,positive
her role was played well.,positive
highly unrecommended.,negative

comfort for our whole family.,positive
join the club and get awesome offers via email.,positive
"i might have gotten a defect, but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.",negative
"this movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen, it confuses you incredibly.",negative
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.,negative
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,positive
this is just a great movie.,positive
"but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.",negative
"i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.",negative
and none of the tones is acceptable.,negative
good transmit audio.,positive
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.,positive
this battery is an excellent bargain!,positive

"this was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!",positive
"i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this?",negative
"in the span of an hour, i had two people exclaim ""whoa - is that the new phone on tv?!?",positive
do not waste your money here!,negative
"this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book, brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award.",positive
horrible!,negative
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,positive
the inside is really quite nice and very clean.,positive
good product - incredible value.,positive
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.highy recommended,positive
"instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.",negative
"best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.",positive
"one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.",positive
"it has a great camera thats 2mp, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.",positive
this is hands down the best phone i've ever had.,positive
we are sending it back.,negative
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone.,negative
disappointment.. i hate anything that goes in my ear.,negative
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.,positive
raw and sublimely moving.,positive
