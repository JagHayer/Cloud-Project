not impressed.,negative
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair.,negative

positive	the ending is so, so perfect... you'll shed a tear.
positive	i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.
positive	i will never forget it now.
positive	it is not just a cult... it is a cult classic.
negative	which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.
negative	the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.
negative	this movie is terrible.
negative	the hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.
negative	for those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!
negative	to call this movie a drama is ridiculous!
negative	started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.
negative	in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.
negative	it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film.
negative	the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.
negative	by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off.
negative	glad i didn't pay to see it.
negative	didn't laugh or even smile once.
negative	but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...
positive	it is a really good show to watch.

" the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.
positive	i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.
positive	in other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.
positive	how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?
positive	it's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.
positive	yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.
negative	this short film certainly pulls no punches.
negative	graphics is far from the best part of the game.
positive	this is the number one best th game in the series.
positive	it deserves strong love.
positive	it is an insane game.
positive	there are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.
positive	waste your money on this game.
positive	this is the kind of money that is wasted properly.
positive	actually, the graphics were good at the time.
negative	today the graphics are crap.
positive	as they say in canada, this is the fun game, aye.
positive	this game rocks.
positive	buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.
positive	it's pure brilliance.
negative	this was a flick doomed from its conception.
negative	the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie.
negative	i wasn't the least bit interested.
negative	not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.
negative	but it's just not funny.
negative	but even the talented carrell can't save this.
negative	his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted.
negative	the story itself is just predictable and lazy.
negative	the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen.
negative	but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.
positive	the film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.
positive	i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.
positive	in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.
positive	it's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.
negative	on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.
negative	long, whiny and pointless.
negative	but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.
positive	excellent cast, story line, performances.
positive	totally believable.
positive	anne heche was utterly convincing.
positive	sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering.
positive	i sat riveted to the tv screen.
positive	all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.
positive	i do think tom hanks is a good actor.
positive	i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.
negative	i was very disappointed in the movie.
negative	one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.
negative	there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.
negative	there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.
negative	this movie totally grates on my nerves.
negative	the performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.
negative	and, quite honestly, often its not very good.
negative	often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.
negative	it crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.
positive	there are some generally great things in it.
negative	i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.
positive	the suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from g to pg.
positive	i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, i could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.
positive	if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.
positive	alexander nevsky is a great film.
positive	he is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.
negative	i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots... it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business"" of quã©bec.",positive

" in fact, it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.
positive	ray charles is legendary.
positive	ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.
positive	hitchcock is a great director.
negative	ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.
positive	secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.
negative	it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.
negative	hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.
negative	the plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.
negative	there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws.
negative	mishima is extremely uninteresting.
negative	this is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.
negative	the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.
negative	and the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.
negative	he can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.
negative	schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.
positive	when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it.
positive	i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.
negative	however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.
negative	i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic.
negative	the character developments also lacked in depth.
negative	woa, talk about awful.
negative	do not waste your time.
negative	it was just too horrible.
negative	the worst, sappiest dialogue... i could go on and on.
negative	but what really made it unwatchable was the direction.
negative	the poor actors.
negative	you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.
negative	if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.
negative	this would not even be good as a made for tv flick.
positive	if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.
positive	the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.
negative	regrettably, the film fails.
negative	the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.
negative	no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie.
positive	yet, i enjoy watching it.
negative	unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.
negative	bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!
negative	the dialogue sucked.
negative	the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.
negative	the soundtrack sucked.
negative	the acting sucked.
negative	the concert sequences just sucked.
positive	that was nice.
positive	that was funny.
positive	it was so funny.
negative	overall, this movie was cheap trash.
negative	but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.
negative	i came out of it feeling angry.
positive	***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, surface is superbly crafted.
positive	the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.
positive	conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).
positive	and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.
positive	all things considered, a job very well done.
positive	thanks good a movie like this was done and released.
positive	one of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.
positive	it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura.
positive	the attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.
positive	it is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.
positive	up there with the best of melville.
positive	everything about this film is simply incredible.
positive	you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.
positive	black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.
positive	the performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.
positive	i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series.
negative	i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.
negative	if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded.
positive	there is a lot of beautiful places.
negative	it was forced, like everything in this movie.
negative	again, lame.
negative	here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.
negative	and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.
negative	when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick.
negative	summary: the witticisms weren't witty.
negative	the plot - well, i said i'd let that one go.
negative	the acting was bad.
negative	really bad.
negative	even billy bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.
negative	camerawork - again, bad.
negative	rating: 1 out of 10.
positive	an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time!
positive	kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.
positive	he is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.
positive	his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.
positive	three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.
positive	and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.
positive	i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her tv, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.
positive	i couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!
positive	i recommend this for everyone who loves film, movies, anything...a work of art!
positive	10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.
negative	i literally vomited while watching this film.
positive	i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.
positive	his performance, as awarded, was stunning.
positive	the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.
positive	in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.
positive	all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.
negative	i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence.
negative	but when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap"".",positive

"however, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldn't receive and place calls.",negative
the bt headset was such a disapoinment.,negative
eew... this location needs a complete overhaul.,negative
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.,negative
"unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.",negative
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,positive
"i've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but i really like it.",positive
definitely a turn off for me & i doubt i'll be back unless someone else is buying.,negative
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.,negative
i highly recommend this case.,positive
does not work.,negative
voice recognition is tremendous!,positive
the instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,negative
"no, i'm going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it.",negative
"still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.",positive
"it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.",negative
could not get strong enough signal.,negative
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.,positive
"even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.",negative
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,negative
"now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.",negative
i hate movies like that.,negative
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.,positive
that's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,positive
"crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.",negative
"he is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.",negative
great for the jawbone.,positive
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.,positive
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,negative
"even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.",negative
fantastic food!,positive
then the film just dropped the ball.,negative
save your money.... i've had this item for 11 months now.,negative
"service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!",positive
"frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.",negative
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone i've had before.,positive
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.,positive
"very good food, great atmosphere.1",positive
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days!!!,negative
worst customer service ever.,negative
having trouble with volume.,negative
there's really nothing bad i can say about this headset.,negative
"for that, it's worth checking out.",positive
"a lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... forever.",negative
the jamaican mojitos are delicious.,positive
the lead man is charisma-free.,negative
"the staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.",negative
"it didn't work, people can not hear me when i talk.",negative
"seriously flavorful delights, folks.",positive
i probably won't be coming back here.,negative
"i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.",positive
you need two hands to operate the screen.this software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,negative
"the servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""are you being helped?""",negative
this is some seriously good pizza and i'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,positive
it was a waste of my money.,negative
service was good and the company was better!,positive
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,negative
no real improvement.,negative
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor!,positive
they really want to make your experience a good one.,positive

"comfortable, nice range, good battery life.",positive
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema.,positive
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience.,positive

"just really good.. so far, probably the best bt headset i have ever had.",positive
both do good jobs and are quite amusing.,positive
don't bother coming here.,negative
check it out.,positive
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.,positive
"so i am here to warn you--do not rent this movie, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!",negative
works great!.,positive
"it works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.",positive
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once (thats when i first used it).,negative
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,negative
definitely worth seeingâ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.,positive
this scene is very strong and unpleasant.,negative
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible.,negative
i never walked out of a movie faster.,negative
"the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.",positive
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.,positive
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,positive
absolutely great.,positive
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.,negative
"it was very popular when i was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.",positive
a pretty good product.,positive
it was quite comfortable in the ear.,positive
i used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.the price of the cable was excellent.,positive
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,negative
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years.,positive
you'll love how thin it is.,positive
i found the product to be easy to set up and use.,positive
couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,positive
this phone might well be the worst i've ever had in any brand.,negative
this pda rocks.,positive
you can find better movies at youtube.,negative
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.,positive
it is perfect for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.,positive
once your food arrives it's meh.,negative
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly.,positive
delete this film from your mind!,negative
they refuse to refund or replace.,negative
it was just not a fun experience.,positive
"if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!",negative
very good stuff for the price.,positive
and the accents are absolutely abysmal!,negative
i really liked that.,positive
i am more than happy with this product.,positive
"the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.",positive
"the service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.",positive
"i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.",negative
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days.,negative
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,negative
don't make the same mistake i did.,negative
"great price, too!",positive
my friend loved the salmon tartar.,positive
i'd love to go back.,positive
very bad experience!,negative

"sound quality on both end is excellent, i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.",positive
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,positive
"there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.",negative
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.,positive
i just wanted to leave.,negative
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,negative
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc (using a usb bluetooth transceiver).,positive
"we thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.",positive
"it's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.",positive
i'm super pissd.,negative
excellent product for the price.,positive
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car.,positive
you get what you pay for i guess.,negative
that one didn't work either.,negative

i would recommend it.,positive
piece of junk.,negative
what a big waste of time.,negative
"this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.",negative

"your servers suck, wait, correction, our server heimer sucked.",negative
"poor service, the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table.",negative
i probably would not go here again.,negative
the problem i have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,negative
the script isâ…was there a script?,negative
"it's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.",positive
high-quality chicken on the chicken caesar salad.,positive
i'd like to return it.,negative
"not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.",positive
you won't regret it!,positive
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,positive
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.,negative
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.,positive
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase.,positive
everything is appalling.,negative
"if you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.",negative
"bad day or not, i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!",negative
"i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so i watched it, twice already, and probably will again.",positive
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted.,positive
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors.,negative
"macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.",positive
not recommended.,negative
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.,positive
"not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.",positive
lame would be the best way to describe it.,negative
i rate this movie 9/10.,positive
"my colleague & i now get great reception.a little expensive, but performance is great.",positive
"very good, though!",positive
battery is terrible.,negative
i'll definitely be in soon again.,positive
it'll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix!,positive
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,negative

"it's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.",positive
will be back again!,positive
i wasn't really impressed with strip steak.,negative
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,negative
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.,positive
"despite how hard i rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.",negative
"it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.",positive
"friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.",negative
go to place for gyros.,positive
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!,negative
"i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",negative
"the wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",negative
the music in the film is really nice too.,positive
"however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.",negative
"otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.",negative
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,negative
a great touch.,positive

the worst phone i've ever had.... only had it for a few months.,negative
"all in all, i'd expected a better consumer experience from motorola.",negative
these are the nicest restaurant owners i've ever come across.,positive
they have great dinners.,positive
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it!,positive
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland.,negative
fantastic service here.,positive
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad.,positive
timely shipment and quality product.,positive
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,negative
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.,negative
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.,negative
it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.,positive
"i'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.",negative
they work about 2 weeks then break.,negative
i did not expect this to be so good!,positive
trumbull on i love lucy).,positive
"the writer, gorman bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.",positive
i dressed up to be treated so rudely!,negative
"with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.",negative
"* comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash sos signals (seriously!",positive
"god, and i can never get that 90 minutes back!",negative
"however, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one.",negative
what this film lacks is a convincing script.,negative
i am sorry i made this purchase.,negative
"okay, i like to consider myself a fair critic, so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.",positive
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,negative
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it purã©ed.,negative
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.,positive
"i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was!",positive
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.,positive
treo and t-mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,negative
too politically correct.,negative
"when my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.",negative
not good enough for the price.,negative
"utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.",negative
"of course, the acting is blah.",negative
"it has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... if you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.",positive
great phone!.,positive
service sucks.,negative
"i mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!",negative
i can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,positive

"our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.",positive
"after one bite, i was hooked.",positive
"tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.",positive
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,negative
absolutel junk.,negative
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone.,negative
"i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.",negative
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again .,positive
awsome device works great!!.,positive
"the chains, which i'm no fan of, beat this place easily.",negative
our server was super nice and checked on us many times.,positive

excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver !,positive
horrible - don't waste your time and money.,negative
really pleased with this product so far.,positive

give this one a look.,positive
the warm beer didn't help.,negative
really good product.,positive
"director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.",positive
i have recommended it to friends.,positive
"i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.",positive
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,negative
i don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.,negative
this was my first time and i can't wait until the next.,positive
all three broke within two months of use.,negative
plan on ordering from them again and again.,positive

happy so far!.,positive
"the casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really bad actors, period.",negative
"the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.",positive
"to sum the film up, ""breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus.",negative
worthwhile.,positive
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste.,negative
food was so gooodd.,positive
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,negative
update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,positive
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,negative
"will never, ever go back.",negative

i love this bluetooth!,positive
very good phone.,positive
amazon sucks.,negative
"lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",positive
crostini that came with the salad was stale.,negative

not worth it.,negative
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...i went to plug it in and it started smoking.,negative
has been working great.,positive
the block was amazing.,positive
great bluetooth!.,positive
- they never brought a salad we asked for.,negative
appetite instantly gone.,negative
the selection was probably the worst i've seen in vegas.....there was none.,negative
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,negative
"the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.",negative
the plug did not work very well.,negative
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.,positive
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,negative

battery lasts only a few hours.,negative
food was great and so was the serivce!,positive
i loved the bacon wrapped dates.,positive
restaurant is always full but never a wait.,positive

product is exactly as described.,positive
would not reccommend.,negative
"i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and i am pretty happy with it.",positive
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,negative
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,positive
great product.,positive
what a mistake that was!,negative
they are so cool!,positive
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,positive

"i've had no trouble accessing the internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.",positive
the food was excellent and service was very good.,positive
i received it quickly and it works great!!,positive
i don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,negative
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time.,negative
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.,positive
"considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.",negative
"feelings, thoughts...gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal.",positive
"i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.",positive
"first of all, it doesn't wear well.",negative
i love their fries and their beans.,positive
"this convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.",negative
"all in all, i can assure you i'll be back.",positive
this is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,positive
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,positive
food was average at best.,negative
awesome device.,positive
waitress was a little slow in service.,negative
we loved the place.,positive
see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.,positive

i liked it.,positive
we'll never go again.,negative

"good value, works fine - power via usb, car, or wall outlet.",positive
i was not impressed by this product.,negative
about half way through this film i started to dislike it.,negative
"when i placed my treo into the case, not only was it not snug, but there was a lot of extra room on the sides.",negative
we won't be returning.,negative
special thanks to dylan t. for the recommendation on what to order :) all yummy for my tummy.,positive
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had.,positive
i promise they won't disappoint.,positive
the movie is terribly boring in places.,negative
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).,positive
"this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (deep impact and armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.",negative
after two i felt disgusting.,negative

"the food is about on par with denny's, which is to say, not good at all.",negative
"a couple of months later, i returned and had an amazing meal.",positive
"they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.",positive
i won't be back.,negative
the sound quality is excellent as well.,positive
"one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well, i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the slavic female character was just too much.",negative
"this place is not worth your time, let alone vegas.",negative
